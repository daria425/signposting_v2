# Whatsapp Signposting Service

A Whatsapp-based application I am working on as part of my internship at <a href="https://www.projectalix.com">Alix</a>
</br>
The tool combines Twilio Programmable Messaging with a REST API in order to send automated whatsapp messages to users and direct them to information on support organizations and charities specified for their query, from a database of over 250 verified organizations.
